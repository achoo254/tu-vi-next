# Switches tuvi.hoandat.com to an uploaded release. Root-owned; installed as
# /usr/local/sbin/tuvi-activate-incoming by setup-deploy-user.sh (and refreshed
# by every manual deploy.sh setup or release), and the only command the CI user
# `tuvi-deploy` may run through sudo.
#   tuvi-activate-incoming <release-id>
# The release waits in /var/www/tuvi/ci-incoming/<id> (writable by the deploy
# user). It is moved out of the deploy user's reach before any check, must hold
# only plain files and directories with the web app, the server bundle and the
# migrations, then becomes releases/<id> and `current`. tuvi-server restarts and
# /healthz (loopback) and https://tuvi.hoandat.com/ (origin) are checked; on
# failure `current` goes back to the previous release, the service restarts and
# the script exits 1. The five newest releases stay. The release id is written
# to apps/web/dist/RELEASE, so https://tuvi.hoandat.com/RELEASE tells which
# release is served. nginx, the unit and these scripts are never taken from the
# upload: they change only through `deploy.sh setup`.
